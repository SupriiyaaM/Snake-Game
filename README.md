# Snake-Game

This project demonstrates how to teach an AI to play the classic game of Snake using reinforcement learning. Built with PyTorch and Pygame, the AI learns to navigate and grow within the game environment through trial and error, maximizing its score over time.

Project Overview :

In this project, we use Deep Q-Learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to train our AI agent. The AI learns from its experiences in the game environment, improving its performance with each iteration. The primary goal is to achieve the highest possible score by consuming food and avoiding collisions.

Key Features :

PyTorch: Utilized for implementing the deep learning model and training algorithms.

Pygame: Provides the game environment where the AI learns and plays.

Deep Q-Learning: Core algorithm used for training the AI agent.

Real-time Visualization: Watch the AI learn and improve its performance over time.
